1. Pulmonary Embolus/Embolism or Not
2. if 1, is it large?
3. if 1, is it saddle (central, straddling the division of the pulmonary arteries)?
4. if 1 and not 3, is it left-sided (vs right?)
5. if 1, is there any evidence of heart strain?

Is there any sort of background change to the lung parenchyma (including, but not limited to emphysema, bronchiectasis, or bullae?)
Well, I guess I wondered about doing 6. Any changes?, then 7. Bronchiectasis? 8. Emphysema? 9. Bullae? 10. Relevant changes that are not 7,8,9
