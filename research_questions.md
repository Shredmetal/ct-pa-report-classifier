1. Pulmonary Embolus/Embolism or Not
2. if 1, is it large?
3. if 1, is it saddle (central, straddling the division of the pulmonary arteries)?
4. if 1 and not 3, is it left-sided (vs right?)
5. if 1, is there any evidence of heart strain?

Is there any sort of background change to the lung parenchyma (including, but not limited to emphysema, bronchiectasis, or bullae?)
Well, I guess I wondered about doing 6. Any changes?, then 7. Bronchiectasis? 8. Emphysema? 9. Bullae? 10. Relevant changes that are not 7,8,9

 the main changes of interest would be
  - Bronchiectasis: widening of the airways which leads to difficulty in self-cleaning and risk of recurrent infection
  - Bronchial Wall Thickening (Bronchial thickening): Thickening of the linings of the airways, usually due to inflammation
  - Emphysema: degradation of the walls of the spongy parts of the lungs, leading to larger air spaces with less surface area
  - Bullae: type of emphysema with large (>10mm) ‘bubbles’ with minimal surfaces for gas exchange. More flexible than regular lung - expands more on breathing in, reducing effectiveness of healthy lung 
  - Bronchiolitis: inflammation of small airways seen in viral and some autoimmue problems
  - Bronchiolitis Obliterans: 
  - Mosaic changes:
  - Air trapping:
  - Tree-in-bud changes:
  - Consolidation (Ground glass changes): Often infective
  - Nodules: dots, fleshy lumps, etc within the lung itself, May be lymph nodes, inflammatory, infective, cancerous, etc. Long-standing nodules can become calcified
  - Cavitation:
