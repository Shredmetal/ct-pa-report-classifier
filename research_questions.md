1. Pulmonary Embolus/Embolism or Not
2. if 1, is it large?
3. if 1, is it saddle (central, straddling the division of the pulmonary arteries)?
4. if 1 and not 3, is it left-sided (vs right?)
5. if 1, is there any evidence of heart strain?

Is there any sort of background change to the lung parenchyma (including, but not limited to emphysema, bronchiectasis, or bullae?)
Well, I guess I wondered about doing 6. Any changes?, then 7. Bronchiectasis? 8. Emphysema? 9. Bullae? 10. Relevant changes that are not 7,8,9

the main changes of interest would be
  - Bronchiectasis: widening of the airways which leads to difficulty in self-cleaning and risk of recurrent infection
  - Bronchial Wall Thickening (Bronchial thickening): Thickening of the linings of the airways, usually due to inflammation
  - Emphysema: degradation of the walls of the spongy parts of the lungs, leading to larger air spaces with less surface area
  - Hyperinflation: These lungs have gone from small, spongy, and elastic, to big, blown-out, and floppy
  - Bullae: type of emphysema with large (>10mm) ‘bubbles’ with minimal surfaces for gas exchange. More flexible than regular lung - expands more on breathing in, reducing effectiveness of healthy lung 
  - Bronchiolitis: inflammation of small airways seen in viral and some autoimmue problems 
  - Mosaic Pattern: Patchwork pattern of higher and lower density associated with various conditions (including pulmonary oedema, pulmonary haemorrage, small airway changes, and others)
  - Nodules: dots, fleshy lumps, etc within the lung itself, May be lymph nodes, inflammatory, infective, cancerous, etc. Long-standing nodules can become calcified
  - Cavitation: Areas of damaged lung with central empty space and thick irregular boundary. Seen in TB, severe (cavitating) pneumonia, and other conditions
  - Air trapping: Areas of relatively more expanded lung seen in Asthma and other conditions
  - Crazy Paving Pattern: Ground glass changes, intralobular septal thickening, and interlobular septal thickening together. Non-specific, often Pulmonary Oedema or severe infection
  - Tree-in-bud Pattern: numerous small nodules (air-spaces full of puss) in lines centred around airways or vessels, seen in various conditions including TB
  - Head cheese Pattern (yeah, that’s a real thing): Characteristic change with well-defined areas of different density associated with Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis
  - Consolidation (Ground glass changes): Often infective
